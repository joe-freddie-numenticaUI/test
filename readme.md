### 🔒 Security Notes
 
- **Admin endpoints** (`/collections`, `/usage`, `/validate-key`) require Strapi admin authentication and are not publicly accessible.
- **Your OpenAI API key** is stored in the Strapi plugin store and is never returned to the browser in plaintext.
- **The `/ask` endpoint** is public (required by your frontend chatbot widget). In production, apply rate limiting at your reverse-proxy or CDN to prevent billing abuse.
 
---
 
### ⚠️ Troubleshooting
 
- Make sure the base domain is correct.
- Only enter FAQs into the Chatbot-FAQ collection after providing the API key.
- If you see a version mismatch during install, run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
